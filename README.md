# DSP_apps_testbench_VHDL
In this single file project, how to read the signals created in matlab and written to bin file in digital design testbench is shown. You can edit the testbench according to your design, the size of the signals, the input / output signals in the design, etc., but the process of reading the signals from the bin file will generally remain the same.
